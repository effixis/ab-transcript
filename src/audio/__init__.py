"""
Audio capture and processing module for speech-to-text transcription.

This package provides a complete solution for recording audio from multiple devices,
transcribing speech to text using OpenAI Whisper, and identifying speakers using
pyannote.audio diarization.

Main components:
- AudioCapture: Multi-device audio recording with WASAPI loopback support
- AudioTranscriber: Speech-to-text using Whisper with hallucination filtering
- PyannoteDiarizer: Speaker identification and diarization
- Utility functions: Audio processing, device categorization, and file operations

Example usage:
    from src.audio import AudioCapture, AudioTranscriber

    # Record audio
    capture = AudioCapture()
    devices = capture.list_devices()
    audio_files = capture.record_multi_device(...)

    # Transcribe
    transcriber = AudioTranscriber(model_name="base")
    result = transcriber.transcribe_multiple(audio_files, device_names)
