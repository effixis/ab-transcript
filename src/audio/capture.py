Audio capture functionality using pyaudiowpatch for Windows WASAPI support.

This module handles recording audio from multiple devices simultaneously, including
microphones and system loopback devices. It uses threading to capture from multiple
sources in parallel and saves each stream to separate WAV files.

Key features:
- Multi-device simultaneous recording
- WASAPI loopback support for system audio capture
- Audio level detection for device testing
- Thread-safe recording with error handling
